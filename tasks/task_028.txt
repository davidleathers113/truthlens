Integration points:
- Connect with Visual Indicator System (Task 9) to test different indicator styles
- Integrate with Popup Interface (Task 10) for feedback collection
- Utilize Storage Service (Task 5) for test data persistence
- Implement hooks in Content Script (Task 3) for in-page testing

The framework should be configurable to run in both development and production environments with appropriate safeguards and user consent mechanisms.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write Jest tests for each component of the testing framework
   - Verify metrics collection accuracy with mock interaction data
   - Test A/B test variant distribution for statistical validity
   - Validate data storage and retrieval functionality

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test integration with Visual Indicator System using simulated user interactions
   - Verify proper data flow between testing framework and storage service
   - Validate popup interface feedback collection with mock submissions
   - Test content script hooks with various page scenarios

3. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct controlled testing sessions with actual Gen Z users (15-25 age range)
   - Compare metrics from framework with observed behaviors
   - Validate that 8-second attention span metrics correlate with actual engagement
   - Verify mobile interaction patterns match expected Gen Z behaviors

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure impact of testing framework on page load times and performance
   - Optimize data collection to minimize performance impact
   - Test under various network conditions to ensure reliable data collection
   - Verify battery usage on mobile devices remains within acceptable limits

5. Data Validation:
   - Compare collected metrics against established Gen Z UX research
   - Validate statistical significance of A/B test results
   - Verify demographic data collection accuracy
   - Test data visualization accuracy in analytics dashboard

6. Cross-Browser/Device Testing:
   - Test framework on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Verify functionality across iOS and Android devices
   - Test on various screen sizes and resolutions
   - Validate touch interaction tracking on different mobile platforms
