# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Chrome Built-in AI Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate with Chrome's Built-in AI (Gemini Nano) for local content analysis.
# Details:
Implement the AI service (src/background/ai/aiService.ts) to integrate with Chrome Built-in AI:

1. Initialize and configure Gemini Nano model for content analysis
2. Create prompt templates for credibility assessment
3. Implement result parsing and scoring normalization
4. Develop fallback mechanisms for environments without AI support

The AI service should provide these key methods:
- `analyzeContent(content: ContentAnalysis): Promise<CredibilityScore>`
- `detectBias(content: ContentAnalysis): Promise<BiasAnalysis>`
- `isAIAvailable(): Promise<boolean>`

Optimize prompts for credibility analysis with specific criteria:
- Source reputation and authority assessment
- Content quality and factual accuracy indicators
- Bias detection and neutrality evaluation
- Citation and evidence presence

Implement a fallback system using traditional heuristics (keyword analysis, source checking) when Chrome Built-in AI is unavailable.

# Test Strategy:
Test AI integration with sample content across various credibility levels. Validate scoring consistency with known reliable/unreliable sources. Measure performance and response times. Test fallback mechanism by disabling AI access. Verify prompt effectiveness with different content types.
