# Task ID: 31
# Title: Implement WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility Compliance
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9, 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive accessibility features to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards across all desktop Chrome extension interfaces, including screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and color contrast validation for the extension popup, options pages, and content script indicators.
# Details:
Implement accessibility compliance across all desktop Chrome extension components with the following approach:

1. Screen Reader Support:
   - Add proper ARIA attributes to all interactive elements
   - Ensure all visual indicators have appropriate text alternatives
   - Implement announcements for dynamic content changes
   - Test with popular screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)

2. Keyboard Navigation:
   - Implement logical tab order for all interactive elements
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions (documented in help section)
   - Ensure focus indicators are visible and meet contrast requirements
   - Implement keyboard traps prevention for modals and popups

3. Color Contrast Validation:
   - Audit all text elements to ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text
   - Ensure 3:1 contrast ratio for large text (18pt+)
   - Implement alternative themes for users with visual impairments
   - Add high contrast mode option in settings

4. Semantic HTML Structure:
   - Use appropriate heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
   - Implement proper landmark regions (main, nav, etc.)
   - Ensure form elements have associated labels
   - Use HTML5 semantic elements throughout

5. Focus Management:
   - Implement proper focus management for dynamic content
   - Ensure focus is moved appropriately after actions
   - Add skip navigation links where appropriate
   - Test focus order with keyboard-only navigation

6. Accessibility in Extension Components:
   - Visual Indicator System: Ensure indicators are perceivable without color alone
   - Popup Interface: Implement full keyboard accessibility and screen reader support
   - Settings/Options Page: Create accessible form controls with proper validation feedback

7. Documentation:
   - Create accessibility statement in help section
   - Document keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features
   - Add accessibility section to developer documentation
   - Include accessibility considerations in component documentation

Implementation should follow these technical guidelines:
- Use React's accessibility features and ARIA where appropriate
- Implement focus management using refs and useEffect hooks
- Create reusable accessible components for common UI patterns
- Add accessibility unit tests for all components

# Test Strategy:
Implement a comprehensive accessibility testing strategy for desktop Chrome extension interfaces:

1. Automated Testing:
   - Integrate axe-core or similar accessibility testing library into CI/CD pipeline
   - Run automated tests on all UI components to catch common issues
   - Create custom accessibility test rules for extension-specific patterns
   - Generate accessibility reports as part of build process

2. Manual Testing:
   - Perform keyboard-only navigation testing on all extension interfaces
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) on Chrome browser
   - Verify color contrast using tools like Color Contrast Analyzer
   - Test with browser zoom levels (up to 200%)

3. User Testing:
   - Conduct testing sessions with users who have disabilities
   - Include users with visual, motor, and cognitive impairments
   - Document feedback and implement necessary changes
   - Create a panel of accessibility testers for ongoing feedback

4. Specific Test Cases:
   - Verify all interactive elements in extension UI are keyboard accessible
   - Confirm screen readers announce all important content in popup and options pages
   - Test color contrast in all themes and visual states
   - Verify focus indicators are visible in all contexts
   - Test with different assistive technologies on desktop
   - Verify proper heading structure and landmark regions
   - Test form validation error messages for accessibility
   - Verify all images have appropriate alt text

5. Compliance Verification:
   - Create a WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checklist for desktop browser context
   - Document evidence of compliance for each success criterion
   - Perform a final accessibility audit before release
   - Generate accessibility conformance report

6. Regression Testing:
   - Add accessibility tests to regression test suite
   - Verify accessibility is maintained after UI changes
   - Include accessibility checks in code review process
   - Monitor accessibility issues in production

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Semantic HTML Structure and ARIA Attributes [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refactor the codebase to use proper semantic HTML elements and add appropriate ARIA attributes to all interactive elements.
### Details:
Audit all components and update them to use semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, section, etc.). Implement proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6) throughout the application. Add ARIA roles, states, and properties to interactive elements. Ensure all form elements have associated labels and proper descriptions. Create landmark regions for better screen reader navigation.

## 2. Implement Keyboard Navigation and Focus Management [done]
### Dependencies: 31.1
### Description: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible with proper focus management and visible focus indicators.
### Details:
Implement logical tab order for all interactive elements. Add visible focus indicators that meet contrast requirements. Create skip navigation links for main content. Implement keyboard traps prevention for modals and popups. Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions and document them. Use React refs and useEffect hooks to manage focus when content changes dynamically.

## 3. Implement Color Contrast and Visual Accessibility [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all text and visual elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements and provide alternatives for color-based information.
### Details:
Audit all text elements to ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Create a high contrast theme option in settings. Ensure all visual indicators provide information through means other than color alone. Implement alternative themes for users with visual impairments. Use CSS custom properties to manage color themes consistently.

## 4. Implement Screen Reader Support for Dynamic Content [done]
### Dependencies: 31.1, 31.2
### Description: Ensure all dynamic content changes are properly announced to screen reader users.
### Details:
Implement live regions for dynamic content updates. Create appropriate announcements for state changes. Ensure all visual indicators have text alternatives. Test with popular screen readers to verify proper announcements. Use aria-live attributes with appropriate politeness levels based on content importance.

## 6. Implement Accessible Components for Core Extension Features [done]
### Dependencies: 31.1, 31.2, 31.3, 31.4
### Description: Refactor core extension components to be fully accessible, including the Visual Indicator System, Popup Interface, and Options Page.
### Details:
Visual Indicator System: Ensure indicators are perceivable without color alone. Popup Interface: Implement full keyboard accessibility and screen reader support. Options Page: Create accessible form controls with proper validation feedback. Implement focus management for all interactive components. Create reusable accessible components for common UI patterns in the extension.

## 7. Create Accessibility Documentation and Testing Framework [done]
### Dependencies: 31.1, 31.2, 31.3, 31.4, 31.6
### Description: Document all accessibility features and implement a comprehensive testing framework to ensure ongoing compliance.
### Details:
Create an accessibility statement in the help section. Document all keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features. Add accessibility section to developer documentation. Include accessibility considerations in component documentation. Implement automated accessibility testing in the CI/CD pipeline using tools like axe-core or jest-axe. Create a checklist for manual accessibility testing focused on desktop Chrome extension interfaces.

## 8. Desktop Browser Zoom and Display Compatibility [done]

### Details:
Test extension interfaces at browser zoom levels up to 200%. Ensure text remains readable and interfaces functional when zoomed. Verify that extension popup and options pages adapt appropriately to different display densities and screen resolutions. Implement responsive designs that maintain accessibility at different zoom levels.
