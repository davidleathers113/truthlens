# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Service Worker Architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the background service worker to handle AI processing, API calls, and data storage.
# Details:
Implement the background service worker (src/background/index.ts) with the following components:

1. Message handling system for communication with content scripts and popup
2. Chrome Built-in AI integration (Gemini Nano) for local content analysis
3. Storage service integration for caching results
4. Error handling and logging system

The service worker should:
- Initialize on extension installation/update
- Register message listeners for content script requests
- Implement the AI analysis service with Chrome Built-in AI
- Handle storage operations for caching and settings

Implement a fallback mechanism for environments where Chrome Built-in AI is not available, using traditional algorithms for basic content analysis.

Use Chrome's persistent storage for caching with a 24-hour TTL by default (configurable in user settings).

# Test Strategy:
Unit test the service worker initialization, message handling, and storage operations. Mock Chrome Built-in AI API to test AI integration. Verify proper error handling by simulating various failure scenarios. Test cache invalidation logic with different TTL configurations.
