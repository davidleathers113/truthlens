# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement Freemium Business Model Logic
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core freemium business model using a hybrid architecture where the Chrome extension handles client-side operations and an external backend service manages server-side operations including payment processing, subscription management, and data persistence.
# Details:
Develop the freemium business model implementation with a hybrid architecture approach:

1. Usage Limitation System:
   - Implement a client-side daily check counter in the extension that tracks free users' usage (limit: 50 checks per day)
   - Create a rolling window mechanism to reset counters at midnight in user's local timezone
   - Design graceful degradation when limits are reached with clear upgrade messaging
   - Sync usage data with backend service periodically to prevent manipulation

2. Subscription Management:
   - Backend service: Integrate with payment processor (Stripe recommended) for handling subscriptions
   - Backend service: Implement webhook handlers for subscription events (created, updated, canceled)
   - Create secure token-based verification system for subscription status validation in the extension
   - Design subscription data model with plan types, billing periods, and status tracking in the backend

3. Premium Feature Gating:
   - Develop a feature flag system in the extension to control access to premium features
   - Implement permission checks before premium operations with backend validation
   - Create upgrade prompts with clear value proposition when free users attempt premium actions
   - Design feature discovery mechanisms to showcase premium capabilities

4. Usage Analytics:
   - Track key metrics in the extension: daily checks, premium feature attempts, conversion rates
   - Send anonymized analytics events to backend service for processing and storage
   - Create dashboard data endpoints for business intelligence in the backend service
   - Set up conversion funnel tracking with defined stages

5. Technical Implementation:
   - Extension: Implement local storage for temporary usage data with periodic backend synchronization
   - Backend service: Provide secure API endpoints for subscription validation and data persistence
   - Extension: Implement secure API calls to backend service compliant with Manifest V3 requirements
   - Design the system to work offline with periodic online validation when connection is restored

6. User Experience:
   - Develop clear UI indicators in the extension for usage limits and premium features
   - Create seamless upgrade flows that redirect to external payment pages with minimal friction
   - Implement account management interfaces in the extension that communicate with the backend
   - Design notification system for approaching limits and renewal reminders

7. Security & Compliance:
   - Implement secure communication between extension and backend using proper authentication
   - Ensure GDPR compliance for data handling between extension and backend service
   - Follow Chrome extension Manifest V3 security requirements
   - Implement proper data minimization practices

The implementation should be modular and extensible to support future pricing tiers and promotional offers.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write tests for the extension's usage counter logic with various scenarios (new user, approaching limit, at limit)
   - Test subscription validation with mocked backend API responses
   - Verify feature gating logic correctly identifies and restricts premium features
   - Test timezone handling for usage reset functionality
   - Test backend service API endpoints with mocked requests

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify extension-to-backend communication for data synchronization
   - Test the complete subscription flow from purchase initiation to activation
   - Validate webhook handling for all subscription events in the backend service
   - Ensure analytics events are properly captured in the extension and transmitted to the backend

3. End-to-End Testing:
   - Create test accounts with various subscription states
   - Verify the complete user journey from free to premium across extension and backend
   - Test upgrade prompts appear at appropriate times in the extension
   - Validate limit reset functionality over multiple days
   - Test the system's behavior during network interruptions

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure impact of tracking and validation on extension performance
   - Test system behavior under high usage conditions
   - Verify offline functionality works as expected
   - Test backend service API response times under load

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create test scenarios for common user journeys across the hybrid architecture
   - Validate clarity of messaging around limits and premium features
   - Test with different browser environments and settings
   - Verify accessibility of upgrade flows and subscription management

6. Analytics Validation:
   - Confirm all conversion events are properly tracked in the extension and transmitted to backend
   - Verify accuracy of usage metrics and reporting
   - Test dashboard data for consistency and completeness
   - Validate data synchronization between extension and backend

7. Payment Processing:
   - Test with Stripe test mode for all subscription scenarios
   - Verify handling of failed payments and retries
   - Test subscription cancellation and reactivation flows
   - Validate the secure redirect flow to external payment pages

8. Security Testing:
   - Test authentication between extension and backend service
   - Verify data encryption in transit and at rest
   - Test for common vulnerabilities in the API endpoints
   - Validate GDPR compliance mechanisms
