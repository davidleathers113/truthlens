# Task ID: 12
# Title: Develop Credibility Scoring Algorithm
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core algorithm for calculating content credibility scores, ensuring compliance with 2025 AI regulations (GDPR AI Act).
# Details:
Implement the credibility scoring algorithm (src/background/scoring/credibilityScoring.ts) with the following components:

1. Multi-factor scoring system (with multi-source validation):
   - Domain Authority (40%): Based on established domain reputation
   - Content Analysis (35%): AI-powered content quality assessment
   - Fact-Check Correlation (20%): External fact-checking API results
   - User Feedback (5%): Community verification and corrections
   - Target overall system accuracy: 95%
   - Response time: <1 second per scoring operation

2. Score normalization and calibration:
   - Scale raw scores to 0-100 range
   - Apply confidence weighting based on available signals
   - Handle missing data with appropriate defaults

3. Threshold definitions:
   - Green (80-100): Highly credible content
   - Yellow (50-79): Moderate credibility or mixed signals
   - Red (0-49): Low credibility or potential misinformation

4. Compliance and transparency (2025 AI Act):
   - Implement bias assessment module to detect and mitigate algorithmic bias in scoring
   - Ensure transparent decision-making with explainable AI: provide clear, user-facing explanations for each score
   - Add human review checkpoints for flagged or borderline cases
   - Document audit trails for all scoring decisions, including input data, scoring factors, and rationale
   - Implement real-time monitoring for compliance, performance, and anomaly detection

5. Domain reputation checking:
   - Use a local database of known domains with pre-calculated reputation scores for the top 5,000 domains

6. Content quality assessment:
   - Use Chrome Built-in AI with specific criteria:
     - Factual accuracy and evidence presence
     - Source citation and reference quality
     - Logical consistency and argument structure
     - Emotional language and sensationalism detection

7. Confidence scoring system:
   - Indicate the reliability of the overall credibility score based on available signals and analysis quality

All components must be auditable and support regulatory reporting requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Test scoring algorithm with known credible and non-credible content. Verify score distribution across a large sample of websites. Test handling of edge cases (minimal content, new domains). Validate confidence scoring with varying levels of available signals. Benchmark algorithm performance and accuracy against professional fact-checkers. Test bias assessment and explainability features for regulatory compliance. Simulate human review checkpoints and audit trail generation. Measure response time to ensure <1 second latency.
