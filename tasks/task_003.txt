# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Content Script Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the content script architecture to analyze web pages and inject visual indicators.
# Details:
Implement the content script infrastructure (src/content/index.ts) with the following components:

1. Page initialization and readiness detection
2. Content extraction system with platform detection
3. Communication with background service worker
4. Visual indicator injection and management

The content script should:
- Load efficiently without blocking page rendering
- Detect when the page is ready for analysis
- Extract relevant content based on the detected platform
- Send content to the background service worker for analysis
- Receive and display credibility scores
- Handle DOM mutations for dynamic content (using MutationObserver)

Implement a platform detection system that identifies the current website (news, social media, etc.) and applies the appropriate content extraction strategy.

Use a throttled approach for dynamic content to prevent performance issues, with a minimum 500ms delay between analyses.

# Test Strategy:
Test content script initialization on various websites. Verify platform detection accuracy for major sites. Test content extraction with sample DOM structures. Validate communication with the background service worker using mocks. Measure performance impact on page load times.
