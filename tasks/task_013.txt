# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Domain Reputation Database
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a local database of domain reputation scores for quick credibility assessment.
# Details:
Develop a domain reputation database system:

1. Create a compressed JSON database of domain reputation scores for top 5,000 domains
2. Implement efficient lookup and caching mechanisms
3. Develop update mechanism for database refreshes
4. Create fallback for domains not in the database

The domain database should include:
- Domain name and normalized variants
- Reputation score (0-100)
- Category classification (news, blog, social, etc.)
- Known bias orientation (if applicable)
- Last updated timestamp

Compile the initial database from reputable sources:
- Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) ratings
- NewsGuard scores
- Academic research on news source reliability
- Industry reputation indices

Implement an efficient lookup system with O(1) complexity using hash tables and optimize the database size (<1MB) for extension performance.

Create a monthly update mechanism for premium users to receive the latest domain reputation data.

# Test Strategy:
Test database lookup performance with various domains. Verify accuracy of reputation scores against source data. Test handling of subdomains and URL variants. Validate update mechanism with mock data. Measure memory usage and loading performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Domain Reputation Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the database schema for storing domain reputation information, including all required fields and data types.
### Details:
Create a schema that includes: domain name (primary key), normalized variants (array), reputation score (0-100 integer), category classification (string enum), bias orientation (string or null), and last updated timestamp. Design the schema to be space-efficient while supporting fast lookups. Consider using a compressed JSON format with minimal field names to reduce size.

## 2. Compile Initial Domain Reputation Dataset [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Gather and compile reputation data for top 5,000 domains from reputable sources into the defined schema format.
### Details:
Collect domain reputation data from MBFC ratings, NewsGuard scores, academic research papers, and industry reputation indices. Normalize scores to a 0-100 scale. Resolve conflicts between different sources using a weighted average approach. Focus on top news, social media, and information sites. Store the compiled data in the schema defined in subtask 1, ensuring the total size remains under 1MB through appropriate compression techniques.

## 3. Implement Domain Lookup and Caching System [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create an efficient O(1) lookup mechanism for domain reputation data with caching to optimize repeated lookups.
### Details:
Implement a hash table-based lookup system for domain names. Include normalization logic to handle subdomains and variants (e.g., 'www.' prefixes). Create an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache to store frequently accessed domain data in memory. Implement fallback logic for domains not found in the database, potentially using parent domain reputation or default values based on TLD reputation patterns.

## 4. Develop Database Compression and Loading System [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Create mechanisms to compress the database for storage and efficiently load it into memory when needed.
### Details:
Implement JSON compression techniques to minimize database size while maintaining fast access. Consider using techniques like field name minimization, integer encoding for scores, and removing redundant data. Create a lazy-loading system that only loads the database into memory when first needed. Implement efficient deserialization to minimize startup impact. Ensure the compressed database is under 1MB for optimal extension performance.

## 5. Create Database Update Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3, 13.4
### Description: Implement a system to update the domain reputation database with fresh data on a monthly basis for premium users.
### Details:
Develop an update mechanism that can fetch new reputation data from a server endpoint. Implement differential updates to minimize bandwidth usage. Include version tracking to determine when updates are available. Add logic to schedule updates on a monthly basis for premium users. Implement error handling and rollback capabilities if updates fail. Ensure updates preserve user-specific customizations to domain reputations.

## 6. Integrate Domain Reputation with Credibility Scoring Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3, 13.5
### Description: Connect the domain reputation database to the overall credibility scoring system and implement fallback mechanisms.
### Details:
Integrate domain reputation lookups into the credibility scoring algorithm. Implement weighting logic to determine how domain reputation affects overall credibility scores. Create fallback mechanisms for unknown domains, including pattern matching with known domains, TLD reputation assessment, and WHOIS data age consideration. Add an API for the UI to display domain reputation information to users. Include methods for users to submit corrections or updates to domain reputation data.
