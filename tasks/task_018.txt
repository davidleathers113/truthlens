# Task ID: 18
# Title: Create Advanced Bias Detection System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 12, 15
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop an advanced system for detecting and analyzing content bias (premium feature).
# Details:
Implement the advanced bias detection system (premium feature):

1. Bias analysis algorithm:
   - Political leaning detection (left/center/right spectrum)
   - Emotional language assessment
   - Framing and narrative analysis
   - Source bias correlation

2. Visualization components:
   - Political spectrum indicator
   - Bias factor breakdown
   - Comparative analysis with similar sources

3. Educational content:
   - Bias explanation and context
   - Balanced source recommendations
   - Media literacy guidance

Develop the bias detection algorithm using Chrome Built-in AI with specific prompts for:
- Political leaning identification based on language and framing
- Emotional content measurement (neutral vs. charged language)
- Narrative techniques and framing analysis
- Balance of perspectives presented

Create a political spectrum visualization that shows:
- Left-center-right positioning with gradient
- Confidence level of the assessment
- Comparative positioning with similar sources
- Historical trend for the source (if available)

Implement educational components that explain:
- What bias means in this context
- How to interpret the bias assessment
- Strategies for seeking balanced information
- Recommendations for complementary sources

# Test Strategy:
Test bias detection with content from known left/center/right sources. Verify visualization accuracy and clarity. Test educational content effectiveness with user feedback. Validate algorithm consistency across similar content. Measure performance impact of advanced analysis.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Political Leaning Detection Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core algorithm to detect political leaning (left/center/right) in content using Chrome Built-in AI.
### Details:
Create a system that analyzes text for political indicators using Chrome Built-in AI. Implement specific prompts that identify language patterns, topic framing, and keyword analysis associated with different political positions. The algorithm should output a political leaning score on a scale from -10 (far left) to +10 (far right), with confidence levels. Include detection of partisan terminology, policy positions, and source attribution patterns.

## 2. Develop Emotional and Linguistic Bias Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Create algorithms to detect emotional language, framing techniques, and linguistic bias indicators in content.
### Details:
Build upon the political leaning detection by implementing analysis for: 1) Emotional content measurement (detecting charged vs. neutral language, emotional appeals, fear/anger triggers), 2) Narrative framing techniques (identifying how stories are presented, what's emphasized/omitted), 3) Linguistic bias indicators (loaded terms, subjective adjectives, passive voice usage patterns). Output should include quantitative scores for emotional intensity and qualitative assessment of framing techniques.

## 3. Implement Source Bias Correlation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2
### Description: Develop a system to correlate content bias with source reputation and historical bias patterns.
### Details:
Create a database of known sources with their historical bias patterns. Implement a correlation system that: 1) Identifies the content source, 2) Retrieves historical bias data for that source, 3) Compares current content analysis with historical patterns, 4) Identifies confirmation bias patterns where sources consistently frame issues in particular ways. The system should generate a source reliability score and highlight patterns of consistent bias.

## 4. Create Political Spectrum and Bias Visualization Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2, 18.3
### Description: Develop interactive visualizations to display bias analysis results in an intuitive format.
### Details:
Implement visualization components including: 1) Political spectrum indicator showing left-center-right positioning with gradient and confidence level, 2) Bias factor breakdown chart showing contribution of different factors to overall bias assessment, 3) Comparative analysis visualization showing the current source positioned against similar sources, 4) Historical trend graph for sources with multiple analyzed pieces. Use D3.js or similar library for interactive visualizations that respond to user interaction and provide tooltip explanations.

## 5. Develop Educational Content and Balanced Source Recommendations [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.3, 18.4
### Description: Create educational materials explaining bias concepts and implement a system for recommending balanced alternative sources.
### Details:
Develop educational content including: 1) Contextual explanations of what different types of bias mean, 2) Guides for interpreting bias assessments, 3) Media literacy tips tailored to the specific bias patterns detected. Implement a recommendation engine that suggests complementary sources with different perspectives based on the detected bias. Content should be concise, non-judgmental, and focused on empowering users to make informed decisions.

## 6. Integrate Premium Bias Detection System with Extension [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.5
### Description: Integrate all bias detection components into the extension as a premium feature with appropriate access controls.
### Details:
Integrate all components into a cohesive premium feature: 1) Implement premium feature flagging and access control, 2) Create a unified bias analysis dashboard UI, 3) Optimize performance to ensure analysis runs efficiently, 4) Implement caching for previously analyzed content, 5) Add user preference settings for bias detection sensitivity and display options. Ensure the system works seamlessly with the rest of the extension and provides clear premium upgrade prompts for non-premium users.
