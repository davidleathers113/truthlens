# Task ID: 20
# Title: Develop Analytics and Telemetry System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an opt-in analytics system for monitoring extension performance, usage, and business-critical metrics.
# Details:
Implement the analytics and telemetry system (opt-in only) with focus on business-critical metrics:

1. Privacy-first design:
   - Explicit opt-in requirement
   - Anonymized data collection
   - Local aggregation before transmission
   - Clear user controls and transparency

2. Performance metrics:
   - Response time measurements
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Error rate tracking
   - API performance statistics

3. Business-critical metrics:
   - DAU/MAU ratio (target: 40%)
   - Premium conversion rate (target: 18% by Month 12)
   - User retention cohort analysis
   - Feature-specific engagement rates
   - Acquisition channel effectiveness

4. User engagement analytics:
   - Gen Z user behavior patterns
   - Feature discovery and adoption rates
   - Session frequency and duration
   - Content interaction patterns
   - Abandonment points in user journey

5. A/B testing framework:
   - Conversion optimization experiments
   - Feature variant testing
   - Onboarding flow optimization
   - Pricing model testing
   - UI/UX improvement validation

Design the analytics system with privacy as the primary concern:
- Require explicit user opt-in during onboarding
- Collect only aggregated, anonymized data
- Process data locally before transmission
- Provide clear explanations of all collected metrics
- Allow users to view their own data before transmission

Implement performance monitoring for:
- Analysis response time (target: <1 second)
- Memory usage (target: <50MB overhead)
- CPU utilization during analysis
- Network requests and cache efficiency
- Error rates and types

Create business intelligence dashboard for stakeholders:
- Real-time conversion and engagement metrics
- Cohort analysis for retention patterns
- Gen Z specific behavioral insights
- A/B test results visualization
- Revenue and growth projections based on current metrics

# Test Strategy:
Test opt-in mechanism and user controls. Verify anonymization of collected data. Test local aggregation and transmission. Validate performance metric accuracy. Test analytics dashboard with sample data. Verify A/B testing framework with controlled experiments. Validate business metrics calculations against manual calculations. Test segmentation of Gen Z user data.
