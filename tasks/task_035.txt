# Task ID: 35
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a robust error handling and logging system with user-friendly error messages, automatic error reporting, recovery mechanisms, and debugging tools to enhance user experience and facilitate troubleshooting.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive error handling and logging system across the extension with the following components:

1. **Error Handling Framework**:
   - Create a centralized error handling service in `/src/shared/services/errorHandler.ts`
   - Implement error classification system (network, permission, data, runtime)
   - Design recovery strategies for different error types
   - Add graceful degradation paths for critical functionality

2. **User-Friendly Error Messages**:
   - Develop a message template system with Gen Z-friendly language
   - Create contextual error messages that explain what happened and suggest solutions
   - Implement visual indicators for errors (toast notifications, inline messages)
   - Add progressive disclosure for technical details (expandable error details)

3. **Automatic Error Reporting**:
   - Implement client-side error capture with stack traces and context
   - Create a reporting pipeline to a monitoring service (e.g., Sentry)
   - Add anonymization for sensitive data before reporting
   - Include environment information and extension version with reports

4. **Offline Handling**:
   - Implement detection for offline status
   - Create offline mode with cached functionality
   - Add automatic retry mechanisms when connection is restored
   - Provide clear offline indicators to users

5. **Network Error Recovery**:
   - Implement exponential backoff for API requests
   - Add request queuing for failed network operations
   - Create circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
   - Implement fallback to local processing when possible

6. **Debugging Tools**:
   - Create a developer console in the extension options page
   - Implement log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
   - Add the ability to export logs for troubleshooting
   - Create visual debugging tools for extension state

7. **Integration Points**:
   - Update the service worker to use the error handling system
   - Integrate with content scripts for in-page error handling
   - Add error handling to popup and options interfaces
   - Implement global error boundary for uncaught exceptions

The implementation should prioritize user experience while providing developers with the tools needed to diagnose and fix issues in production.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for each error handling component
   - Test error classification and recovery strategies
   - Verify error message templates for clarity and helpfulness
   - Test offline detection and recovery mechanisms

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify error handling across service worker, content scripts, and UI
   - Test communication of errors between extension components
   - Ensure error boundaries catch and handle exceptions properly
   - Validate that error reporting sends correct data to monitoring services

3. **Scenario Testing**:
   - Simulate network failures and verify recovery behavior
   - Test offline mode functionality and transition back to online
   - Force API errors and verify user-friendly messages appear
   - Test graceful degradation of features during various failure modes

4. **User Experience Testing**:
   - Conduct usability testing with Gen Z users to evaluate error message clarity
   - Verify that error messages provide actionable information
   - Ensure visual error indicators are noticeable but not disruptive
   - Test accessibility of error messages and recovery options

5. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure performance impact of error handling system
   - Verify that error logging doesn't impact extension responsiveness
   - Test memory usage during error conditions
   - Ensure error reporting doesn't consume excessive bandwidth

6. **Production Validation**:
   - Implement a staged rollout to monitor error rates in production
   - Create dashboards to track common errors and resolution rates
   - Verify automatic error reporting is capturing actionable data
   - Test that debugging tools provide sufficient information for issue resolution

Document all test results and update the error handling system based on findings.
