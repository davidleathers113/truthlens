## Problem Statement & Market Analysis

### Critical Problem
1. **Misinformation Crisis**: #1 global risk for 2025, with traditional fact-checking infrastructure collapsing
2. **Platform Abandonment**: Meta eliminated third-party fact-checking (Jan 2025), creating verification void
3. **Gen Z Information Challenge**: 42.9% rely on social media for news, need 8-second feedback cycles
4. **Existing Solutions Gap**: Current tools are desktop-centric, disruptive, expensive, and ignore Gen Z needs

### Target Market
- **Primary**: Gen Z information consumers (ages 16-24) - 800M Chrome users globally
- **Secondary**: Millennials and information-conscious users (ages 25-35)
- **Total Addressable Market**: $2.1B by 2032 (conservative estimate)

### Competitive Landscape Gaps
- **No Gen Z-optimized UX** (8-second attention span design)
- **Poor mobile/social integration** (most focus on traditional news)
- **Disruptive interaction patterns** (require clicking/leaving page)
- **Limited privacy protection** (external APIs, data collection)
- **Outdated AI capabilities** (rule-based vs. modern LLMs)
