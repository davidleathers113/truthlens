# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Build System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with Chrome Manifest V3 structure and configure the build system with Webpack 5.
# Details:
Create a new repository with the following structure:
- `/src`: Source code directory
  - `/background`: Service worker scripts
  - `/content`: Content scripts
  - `/popup`: Extension popup UI
  - `/options`: Settings page
  - `/shared`: Shared utilities and types
- `/public`: Static assets and manifest

Setup Webpack 5 with separate dev/prod configurations:
- TypeScript compilation with ts-loader
- SCSS processing with sass-loader
- Asset optimization for production
- Hot module replacement for development

Implement the manifest.json file according to Chrome Manifest V3 specifications with required permissions:
- `scripting` for content script injection
- `storage` for data persistence
- `activeTab` for current tab access

Install core dependencies:
- React 18
- TypeScript 5.0+
- webextension-polyfill for cross-browser compatibility
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Jest for testing

# Test Strategy:
Verify project structure is correctly set up. Test build process with `npm run build` to ensure it produces valid extension artifacts. Validate manifest.json against Chrome's requirements using the Chrome extension validator.
