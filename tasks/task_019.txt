# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement User Feedback System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9, 14
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a system for collecting and incorporating user feedback on credibility assessments.
# Details:
Develop the user feedback system:

1. Feedback collection interface:
   - Agree/disagree buttons for credibility score
   - Optional comment field for detailed feedback
   - Issue reporting for incorrect analysis

2. Feedback processing:
   - Local storage of user feedback
   - Incorporation into credibility algorithm (5% weight)
   - Aggregation for improvement analysis

3. Community features:
   - Aggregated feedback display (premium)
   - Community consensus indicators
   - Trusted user program (future enhancement)

Implement the feedback interface with:
- Simple thumbs up/down for quick feedback
- Optional detailed feedback form
- Issue categories for specific problems
- Screenshot attachment capability

Create a feedback processing system that:
- Stores feedback locally with the credibility score
- Incorporates user feedback into future scoring (5% weight)
- Identifies patterns for algorithm improvement
- Handles conflicting feedback appropriately

Develop community features (premium) that show:
- Percentage of users who agree/disagree with score
- Community consensus on controversial content
- Trending misinformation reports
- Educational resources based on feedback patterns

# Test Strategy:
Test feedback collection interface usability. Verify feedback storage and retrieval. Test incorporation of feedback into scoring algorithm. Validate community feature displays with mock data. Test conflict resolution with contradictory feedback.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Basic Feedback UI Components [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core UI components for collecting user feedback on credibility assessments, including agree/disagree buttons and a collapsible detailed feedback form.
### Details:
Develop React components for: 1) Thumbs up/down buttons that appear next to credibility scores, 2) A collapsible form with comment field that appears when users want to provide detailed feedback, 3) Basic styling consistent with the extension's design system, 4) Animations for smooth transitions between feedback states.

## 2. Implement Issue Reporting Interface [done]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Create the interface for users to report specific issues with credibility assessments, including categorization and screenshot capabilities.
### Details:
Build on the basic feedback UI by adding: 1) Dropdown for issue categories (factual error, bias detection issue, source reliability problem, etc.), 2) Screenshot capture functionality using browser APIs, 3) Preview of captured screenshots, 4) Form validation to ensure proper issue reporting, 5) Confirmation dialog after submission.

## 3. Develop Feedback Storage System [done]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2
### Description: Create a system to store user feedback locally and prepare it for incorporation into the credibility algorithm.
### Details:
Implement: 1) Data structure for storing feedback (including URL, timestamp, feedback type, user comments, screenshots), 2) IndexedDB storage implementation for local persistence, 3) Encryption for sensitive feedback data, 4) Quota management to prevent excessive storage usage, 5) Data cleanup routines for old feedback.

## 4. Integrate Feedback with Credibility Algorithm [done]
### Dependencies: 19.3
### Description: Modify the credibility scoring algorithm to incorporate user feedback with a 5% weighting factor.
### Details:
Implement: 1) Retrieval of relevant feedback for a given URL or content, 2) Weighting mechanism that applies 5% influence from user feedback to credibility scores, 3) Logic to handle conflicting feedback appropriately (majority rule with recency bias), 4) Feedback quality assessment to filter out potential abuse, 5) Performance optimization to ensure minimal impact on scoring speed.

## 5. Implement Community Consensus Features [done]
### Dependencies: 19.3, 19.4
### Description: Develop premium features that display aggregated feedback and community consensus on credibility assessments.
### Details:
Create: 1) Visual indicators showing percentage of users who agree/disagree with scores, 2) Community consensus badges for content with significant feedback, 3) Trending misinformation reports section, 4) User interface for viewing aggregated feedback statistics, 5) Premium feature gating mechanism, 6) Real-time updates when new feedback is submitted.

## 6. Create Feedback Analytics Dashboard [done]
### Dependencies: 19.3, 19.4, 19.5
### Description: Develop an internal dashboard for analyzing feedback patterns and improving the credibility algorithm based on user input.
### Details:
Implement: 1) Data aggregation system to identify common feedback patterns, 2) Visualization of feedback trends over time, 3) Content categorization based on feedback types, 4) Identification of algorithm weak points based on frequent corrections, 5) Recommendation engine for algorithm improvements, 6) Export functionality for further analysis.
