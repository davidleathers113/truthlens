## CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

1. **GitHub Actions Setup**:
   - Create `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` configuration file
   - Configure workflow triggers for pull requests and merges to main branch
   - Set up caching for dependencies to speed up builds

2. **Automated Testing Integration**:
   - Configure Jest test runner in CI environment
   - Set up unit test automation with coverage reporting
   - Implement integration test automation with Chrome API mocks
   - Configure end-to-end testing with Playwright or Puppeteer
   - Generate and publish test reports as build artifacts

3. **Security Scanning**:
   - Integrate npm audit for dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Set up ESLint security plugin for static code analysis
   - Implement SAST (Static Application Security Testing) with CodeQL
   - Configure automated secret scanning to prevent credential leaks
   - Generate security reports and fail builds on critical issues

4. **Performance Benchmarking**:
   - Implement Lighthouse CI for performance metrics
   - Set up bundle size monitoring with size-limit
   - Configure memory usage tracking for the extension
   - Establish performance budgets and alerts for regressions

5. **Automated Extension Packaging**:
   - Create build script for production-ready extension package
   - Implement version bumping based on semantic versioning
   - Generate release notes from commit messages
   - Create ZIP archive compatible with Chrome Web Store requirements
   - Sign extension package with appropriate keys

6. **Chrome Web Store Deployment**:
   - Set up Chrome Web Store API authentication
   - Implement automated submission to the Chrome Web Store
   - Configure staged rollouts for production releases
   - Set up notification system for deployment status
   - Implement rollback capability for failed deployments

7. **Pipeline Monitoring and Reporting**:
   - Create dashboard for CI/CD pipeline health
   - Set up alerts for pipeline failures
   - Implement build time optimization strategies
   - Configure retention policies for build artifacts
   - Generate weekly pipeline performance reports

8. **Documentation**:
   - Document the CI/CD workflow for the development team
   - Create troubleshooting guide for common pipeline issues
   - Document deployment procedures and rollback processes
   - Maintain a changelog of pipeline configuration changes

# Test Strategy:
## Testing Strategy

1. **Pipeline Configuration Verification**:
   - Validate GitHub Actions workflow syntax with actionlint
   - Test workflow with a sample PR to ensure all jobs run correctly
   - Verify proper sequencing of pipeline stages
   - Confirm environment variables and secrets are properly configured

2. **Test Automation Verification**:
   - Create a failing test and verify it causes pipeline failure
   - Verify test coverage reports are generated correctly
   - Confirm integration tests properly mock Chrome APIs
   - Test end-to-end scenarios with actual extension loading

3. **Security Scanning Validation**:
   - Introduce a known vulnerability and verify detection
   - Test secret scanning by intentionally adding a dummy token
   - Verify security reports are generated and accessible
   - Confirm critical security issues block the pipeline

4. **Performance Testing Verification**:
   - Verify Lighthouse CI reports are generated correctly
   - Test bundle size monitoring by increasing bundle size
   - Confirm performance regression alerts work as expected
   - Validate performance metrics against established baselines

5. **Packaging Verification**:
   - Verify extension package is correctly generated
   - Validate manifest.json in the built package
   - Confirm version bumping works correctly
   - Test package signing process

6. **Deployment Testing**:
   - Test deployment to a test account on Chrome Web Store
   - Verify API authentication and submission process
   - Confirm notification system for deployment status
   - Test rollback procedure with a simulated failed deployment

7. **End-to-End Pipeline Testing**:
   - Run a complete pipeline cycle from commit to deployment
   - Measure total pipeline execution time
   - Verify all artifacts are correctly generated and stored
   - Confirm successful notification of pipeline completion

8. **Documentation Verification**:
   - Review all documentation for accuracy and completeness
   - Verify team members can follow the documentation to troubleshoot issues
   - Test deployment procedures by having a team member follow the documentation
