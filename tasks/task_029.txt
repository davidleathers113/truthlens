# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement Freemium Business Model Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core freemium business model including usage limits for free users, premium feature gating, subscription management, payment integration, and usage analytics tracking.
# Details:
Develop the freemium business model implementation with the following components:

1. Usage Limitation System:
   - Implement a daily check counter that limits free users to 50 checks per day
   - Create a rolling window mechanism to reset counters at midnight in user's local timezone
   - Design graceful degradation when limits are reached with clear upgrade messaging

2. Subscription Management:
   - Integrate with payment processor (Stripe recommended) for handling subscriptions
   - Implement webhook handlers for subscription events (created, updated, canceled)
   - Create secure token-based verification system for subscription status
   - Design subscription data model with plan types, billing periods, and status tracking

3. Premium Feature Gating:
   - Develop a feature flag system to control access to premium features
   - Implement permission checks before premium operations
   - Create upgrade prompts with clear value proposition when free users attempt premium actions
   - Design feature discovery mechanisms to showcase premium capabilities

4. Usage Analytics:
   - Track key metrics: daily checks, premium feature attempts, conversion rates
   - Implement event logging for user journey analysis
   - Create dashboard data endpoints for business intelligence
   - Set up conversion funnel tracking with defined stages

5. Technical Implementation:
   - Extend the storage service to persist usage data and subscription status
   - Implement secure server-side validation of subscription status
   - Create background processes to sync subscription data
   - Design the system to work offline with periodic online validation

6. User Experience:
   - Develop clear UI indicators for usage limits and premium features
   - Create seamless upgrade flows with minimal friction
   - Implement account management interfaces for subscription control
   - Design notification system for approaching limits and renewal reminders

The implementation should be modular and extensible to support future pricing tiers and promotional offers.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write tests for the usage counter logic with various scenarios (new user, approaching limit, at limit)
   - Test subscription validation with mocked payment provider responses
   - Verify feature gating logic correctly identifies and restricts premium features
   - Test timezone handling for usage reset functionality

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify storage service correctly persists and retrieves usage data
   - Test the complete subscription flow from purchase to activation
   - Validate webhook handling for all subscription events
   - Ensure analytics events are properly captured and formatted

3. End-to-End Testing:
   - Create test accounts with various subscription states
   - Verify the complete user journey from free to premium
   - Test upgrade prompts appear at appropriate times
   - Validate limit reset functionality over multiple days

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure impact of tracking and validation on extension performance
   - Test system behavior under high usage conditions
   - Verify offline functionality works as expected

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create test scenarios for common user journeys
   - Validate clarity of messaging around limits and premium features
   - Test with different browser environments and settings
   - Verify accessibility of upgrade flows and subscription management

6. Analytics Validation:
   - Confirm all conversion events are properly tracked
   - Verify accuracy of usage metrics and reporting
   - Test dashboard data for consistency and completeness

7. Payment Processing:
   - Test with Stripe test mode for all subscription scenarios
   - Verify handling of failed payments and retries
   - Test subscription cancellation and reactivation flows

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Usage Limitation Counter System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core usage tracking system that counts and limits free users to 50 checks per day with timezone-aware reset functionality.
### Details:
Develop a database schema for storing user usage data with fields for user_id, check_count, last_reset_date, and timezone. Implement a service layer that handles incrementing counters, checking limits, and resetting counters at midnight in the user's local timezone. Use a background job scheduler for the reset process. Include methods for getUsageCount(), incrementUsage(), checkLimitReached(), and resetDailyCounter().

## 2. Develop Feature Flag and Permission System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system to gate premium features and implement permission checks before allowing access to premium functionality.
### Details:
Design a feature flag configuration system with a database table mapping features to subscription tiers. Implement a FeatureGateService with methods like canAccessFeature(userId, featureId) that checks the user's subscription status against feature requirements. Create middleware/interceptors to apply these checks automatically for protected API endpoints or UI components. Include graceful handling for unauthorized access attempts.

## 3. Integrate Stripe Payment Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Stripe integration for handling subscription payments, including API client configuration and secure handling of payment information.
### Details:
Implement a PaymentService that wraps the Stripe API client. Create methods for createSubscription(), updateSubscription(), cancelSubscription(), and getSubscriptionStatus(). Set up secure handling of API keys using environment variables. Implement proper error handling for payment failures and API issues. Use Stripe's test mode for development and testing.

## 4. Implement Subscription Data Model and Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.3
### Description: Create the data model and service layer for managing user subscriptions, including plan types, billing periods, and status tracking.
### Details:
Design database tables for subscription_plans (with tiers, prices, features) and user_subscriptions (with user_id, plan_id, status, start_date, end_date, payment_id). Implement a SubscriptionService with methods to create, retrieve, update, and cancel subscriptions. Include logic for handling trial periods, renewals, and grace periods. Ensure proper indexing for efficient queries.

## 5. Create Webhook Handlers for Subscription Events [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.3, 29.4
### Description: Implement webhook endpoints to receive and process subscription-related events from Stripe, ensuring the application state stays in sync with payment processor events.
### Details:
Create secure webhook endpoints for events like subscription.created, subscription.updated, subscription.deleted, payment_failed, etc. Implement signature verification using Stripe's webhook secrets. Process events asynchronously using a queue system if possible. Update the local subscription database based on webhook events. Log all webhook events for debugging and auditing.

## 6. Implement Usage Analytics Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1, 29.2
### Description: Develop a system to track and analyze user usage patterns, conversion rates, and feature engagement to inform business decisions.
### Details:
Create a database schema for analytics events with fields for user_id, event_type, timestamp, and metadata. Implement an AnalyticsService with methods like trackEvent(), getConversionRate(), and getUserJourney(). Set up scheduled jobs to aggregate daily/weekly/monthly statistics. Create endpoints for retrieving analytics data for dashboards. Focus on tracking key events: feature usage, limit reached, upgrade prompt shown, subscription started/canceled.

## 7. Develop Upgrade Flow and Premium Feature UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1, 29.2, 29.4
### Description: Create user interface components for displaying usage limits, premium feature indicators, and seamless upgrade flows with clear value propositions.
### Details:
Implement UI components for: usage limit indicators (progress bar showing daily usage), premium feature badges/locks, upgrade modal dialogs, and subscription management screens.
