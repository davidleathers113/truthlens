# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive testing framework for ensuring extension quality and reliability.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive testing framework with multiple testing levels:

1. Unit Testing (Jest):
   - Test individual functions and components
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Achieve 80%+ code coverage
   - Automate with CI/CD pipeline

2. Integration Testing (Jest + Chrome APIs):
   - Test communication between components
   - Verify storage and persistence
   - Test API integrations with mocks
   - Validate end-to-end workflows

3. End-to-End Testing (Playwright):
   - Test on actual websites and platforms
   - Verify visual indicators and interactions
   - Test across different browsers (if applicable)
   - Validate real-world scenarios

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure response times and overhead
   - Test memory usage and leaks
   - Verify battery impact on mobile
   - Benchmark against performance targets

Implement test utilities and helpers:
- Mock data generators for various content types
- Chrome API mocks for testing without browser
- Test fixtures for common scenarios
- Visual regression testing for UI components

Create a CI/CD pipeline that runs tests on:
- Every pull request (PR validation)
- Daily builds (regression testing)
- Release candidates (comprehensive testing)
- Production releases (smoke testing)

# Test Strategy:
Meta-testing: Verify test coverage metrics. Test the testing framework itself with known bugs. Validate CI/CD pipeline with test failures. Measure test performance and optimization.
