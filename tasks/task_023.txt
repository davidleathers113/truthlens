# Status: done
# Dependencies: 10, 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an engaging onboarding experience for new users.
# Details:
Develop the onboarding experience for new users:

1. First-run experience:
   - Welcome screen with value proposition
   - Permission explanations and requests
   - Quick setup wizard (3 steps maximum)
   - Privacy settings configuration

2. Feature discovery tour:
   - Interactive walkthrough of key features
   - Contextual tooltips and demonstrations
   - Progress tracking and completion rewards
   - Skip option for advanced users

3. Ongoing education:
   - Progressive feature discovery
   - Tips and tricks notifications
   - Usage milestone celebrations
   - Feedback collection points

Design the onboarding with Gen Z focus:
- Visual-first explanations with minimal text
- Completion time under 60 seconds total
- Emoji-enhanced instructions for quick comprehension
- Mobile-optimized touch interactions
- Skippable sections with easy return path

Implement permission requests with clear explanations:
- Why each permission is needed
- What the extension can/cannot access
- Privacy implications and protections
- Options to limit permissions where possible

Create an adaptive onboarding that:
- Detects user expertise level
- Adjusts detail level accordingly
- Remembers progress across sessions
- Provides different paths for different user types

# Test Strategy:
Test onboarding flow with new users. Measure completion rates and drop-off points. Test permission acceptance rates with different explanations. Validate feature discovery effectiveness. Test onboarding on different devices and platforms.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Welcome Screen and Permission Flow [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the initial welcome screen with value proposition and implement the permission request flow with clear explanations.
### Details:
Build a visually appealing welcome screen with minimal text that communicates the app's core value. Include a brief animation (under 5 seconds) showcasing key benefits. Design permission request cards with emoji-enhanced explanations for each permission, explaining why it's needed, what will be accessed, and privacy protections. Implement a 'Learn More' option for detailed explanations and options to limit permissions where possible.

## 2. Develop Quick Setup Wizard [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Create a 3-step maximum setup wizard that configures essential settings and privacy preferences.
### Details:
Design a streamlined setup process with no more than 3 screens. Use visual toggles and sliders for configuration options. Include privacy settings with clear visual indicators of data sharing levels. Implement touch-optimized controls for mobile users. Add progress indicators showing completion percentage. Ensure the entire setup can be completed in under 30 seconds. Store user preferences securely for future sessions.

## 3. Create Interactive Feature Tour [done]
### Dependencies: 23.2
### Description: Develop an interactive walkthrough of key features with contextual tooltips and demonstrations.
### Details:
Implement an interactive tour highlighting 3-5 core features. Create animated tooltips that appear contextually when users encounter features for the first time. Design interactive demonstrations that allow users to try features with guidance. Add a progress tracker showing tour completion. Implement a skip option that's easily accessible but not prominent. Store tour progress to allow users to continue later.

## 4. Implement User Expertise Detection and Adaptive Content [done]
### Dependencies: 23.2
### Description: Create a system that detects user expertise level and adapts onboarding content accordingly.
### Details:
Develop an algorithm that analyzes initial user interactions to estimate expertise level. Create three content paths: beginner, intermediate, and advanced with varying detail levels. For beginners, provide more guidance and explanations; for advanced users, focus on unique features and power-user capabilities. Implement a mechanism to adjust the estimated expertise level based on ongoing interactions. Store and update the expertise profile across sessions.

## 5. Build Progressive Feature Discovery System [done]
### Dependencies: 23.3, 23.4
### Description: Implement a system for ongoing education through progressive feature discovery, tips, and milestone celebrations.
### Details:
Create a queue system for introducing features gradually over time. Design unobtrusive notifications for tips and tricks that appear based on usage patterns. Implement milestone tracking (e.g., 'You've used feature X 10 times!') with celebratory micro-animations. Develop a feedback collection mechanism that appears at strategic points in the user journey. Ensure all notifications are dismissible and have frequency caps to prevent overwhelming users.

## 6. Implement Analytics and Optimization Framework [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2, 23.3, 23.4, 23.5
### Description: Create a system to track onboarding metrics and optimize the experience based on user behavior data.
### Details:
Implement analytics tracking for key onboarding events: time spent on each screen, completion rates, feature discovery engagement, and permission acceptance. Create funnels to identify drop-off points in the onboarding flow. Build A/B testing capability to compare different onboarding approaches. Develop a dashboard for visualizing onboarding performance metrics. Ensure all analytics respect privacy settings and include appropriate anonymization.
