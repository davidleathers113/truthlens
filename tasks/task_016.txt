# Task ID: 16
# Title: Develop Historical Tracking System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 12, 15
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a system for tracking and displaying historical credibility data for users.
# Details:
Implement the historical tracking system (premium feature):

1. History storage and management:
   - Store visited sites with credibility scores
   - Implement retention policies (30 days default)
   - Provide export capabilities (CSV, JSON)

2. History visualization:
   - List view of recently checked sites
   - Filtering and sorting options
   - Trend analysis and patterns

3. Academic citation generation:
   - Generate formatted citations (APA, MLA, Chicago)
   - Include credibility score and analysis date
   - Export to clipboard or document

Design the history interface with:
- Chronological list of analyzed content
- Search and filter capabilities
- Sorting by date, score, domain
- Batch operations (delete, export)

Implement data retention controls:
- User-configurable retention period (1-90 days)
- Manual clearing options
- Automatic pruning of old entries

Create export functionality with multiple formats:
- CSV for spreadsheet analysis
- JSON for data portability
- PDF for formal reports
- Citation formats for academic use

# Test Strategy:
Test history storage and retrieval. Verify retention policies and pruning. Test export functionality with different formats. Validate citation generation against style guides. Test search and filter capabilities with large history datasets.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement History Storage and Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the database schema and storage mechanisms for tracking historical credibility data.
### Details:
Create database tables for storing visited sites with their credibility scores, timestamps, and user associations. Implement data models with fields for URL, domain, page title, credibility score, analysis date, and user ID. Design the schema to support efficient querying and filtering. Implement the retention policy logic that defaults to 30 days but allows user configuration between 1-90 days. Set up automatic pruning of old entries based on the retention settings.

## 2. Develop History Visualization Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the user interface components for displaying and interacting with historical credibility data.
### Details:
Build a responsive list view of recently checked sites showing key information (URL, title, score, date). Implement filtering controls by date range, domain, and score threshold. Add sorting capabilities by date, score, and domain. Design and implement a trend analysis view that shows patterns in credibility scores over time. Include search functionality to find specific entries. Ensure the interface is accessible and works across different screen sizes.

## 3. Create Data Export Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement features to export historical credibility data in multiple formats.
### Details:
Develop export handlers for CSV, JSON, and PDF formats. Implement batch selection of entries for export. Create data formatters that properly structure the exported data according to each format's requirements. For CSV, include headers and proper escaping. For JSON, create a well-structured object hierarchy. For PDF, design a clean report layout with branding elements. Add progress indicators for large exports and provide download links or direct file saving.

## 4. Implement Academic Citation Generator [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop functionality to generate academic citations in various formats based on credibility data.
### Details:
Create citation generators for APA, MLA, and Chicago styles. Design templates for each citation style that incorporate the URL, page title, access date, credibility score, and analysis date. Implement a preview feature to show the formatted citation before copying or exporting. Add a copy-to-clipboard function for quick use. Create options to include or exclude certain elements in the citation. Ensure the citation format follows the latest style guide specifications.

## 5. Develop User Controls for History Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create interfaces and functionality for users to manage their historical credibility data.
### Details:
Implement user settings for configuring the retention period (1-90 days). Create batch operations for selecting and deleting multiple history entries. Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions. Implement manual clearing options for specific date ranges or domains. Design and implement privacy controls that allow users to pause history tracking temporarily or permanently. Create a data usage dashboard showing storage utilization. Ensure all user controls are intuitive and provide appropriate feedback.
