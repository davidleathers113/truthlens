# TruthLens Permissions Justification

## Chrome Web Store Submission - Detailed Permissions Documentation

### Required Permissions

#### 1. `activeTab` - Current Page Access
**Purpose:** Read content from the currently active webpage for fact-checking analysis
**Usage:**
- Extract text content from news articles and social media posts
- Analyze headlines, article body, and metadata
- Identify claims that require fact-checking
- Insert credibility indicators into the page

**Privacy Protection:**
- Only accesses the current tab when user clicks the extension icon
- Does NOT track browsing history across tabs
- No background monitoring of user activity
- Content analysis happens locally when possible

**User Benefit:** Enables real-time fact-checking without requiring users to copy/paste content

---

#### 2. `storage` - Local Data Storage
**Purpose:** Save user preferences and fact-checking cache locally on user's device
**Usage:**
- Store user settings (theme, notification preferences, analysis level)
- Cache fact-checking results to improve performance
- Remember user's privacy choices and customizations
- Store trusted domain lists and user-defined exceptions

**Privacy Protection:**
- All data stored locally on user's device
- No personal information collected or transmitted
- User can clear extension data at any time
- No cross-device data synchronization without explicit consent

**User Benefit:** Personalized experience that remembers user preferences and avoids re-analyzing content

#### 3. `scripting` - Content Script Injection
**Purpose:** Insert credibility indicators and analysis UI into web pages
**Usage:**
- Display credibility scores as visual overlays
- Show fact-checking results in non-intrusive indicators
- Provide contextual information about content reliability
- Enable interactive fact-checking features on the page

**Privacy Protection:**
- Scripts only run on pages with detectable news/social content
- No modification of user's personal data or form inputs
- Scripts cannot access other extensions or browser data
- All injected content clearly identified as TruthLens features

**User Benefit:** Seamless integration that doesn't require leaving the current page

### Host Permissions

#### `https://*/*` and `http://*/*` - Website Access
**Purpose:** Enable fact-checking on all websites where users consume news and information
**Justification:**
- News and misinformation appear across thousands of websites
- Social media platforms, news sites, blogs all need coverage
- Cannot predict which domains users will need fact-checking on
- Broad permission ensures comprehensive protection

**Limitations Applied:**
- Extension only activates on pages with news/article content
- Dormant on non-content pages (e.g., e-commerce, gaming)
- Content analysis limited to publicly available text
- No access to user's private data, passwords, or personal information

**Alternative Considered:** Site-specific permissions would require users to manually enable the extension on each new site, creating friction and reducing effectiveness against rapidly spreading misinformation.

### Optional Permissions (User Choice)

#### `tabs` - Enhanced Navigation
**When Requested:** Only when user enables "cross-reference checking" feature
**Purpose:** Compare claims across multiple open tabs for comprehensive analysis
**User Control:**
- Explicitly requested during onboarding
- Can be revoked at any time in settings
- Clear explanation of why this enhances fact-checking

#### `notifications` - Alert System
**When Requested:** Only when user enables "credibility alerts"
**Purpose:** Notify users when highly suspicious content is detected
**User Control:**
- Opt-in only during setup process
- Granular control over notification types
- Can be disabled without affecting core functionality

## Privacy-First Design Principles

### 1. Local Processing Priority
- AI analysis runs on user's device when possible
- Chrome's built-in AI APIs used for local fact-checking
- External API calls only for source verification, not content analysis
- No user content sent to third-party services without explicit consent

### 2. Minimal Data Collection
- No user account required
- No personal identifying information collected
- No browsing history stored or transmitted
- Analytics are aggregated and anonymized

### 3. Transparent Operation
- Clear indicators when extension is active
- User can see exactly what content is being analyzed
- One-click access to detailed privacy settings
- Open-source components for community verification

### 4. User Control
- All features can be toggled on/off individually
- Granular privacy controls in easy-to-find settings
- Option to delete all extension data with one click
- Clear explanation of each permission's purpose
