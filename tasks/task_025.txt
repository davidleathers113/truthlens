# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Security Hardening and Compliance
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance extension security and ensure compliance with privacy regulations, including 2025 requirements for AI and data privacy.
# Details:
Implement security hardening and compliance measures:

1. Content Security Policy:
   - Strict CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks
   - No inline scripts or eval() usage
   - Whitelist-only external resource loading
   - Secure communication protocols only
   - Use nonce-based script authorization and strict-dynamic where needed
   - Implement CSP in both enforced and report-only modes for real-time monitoring and policy testing

2. Data protection:
   - Encryption for sensitive stored data
   - Secure deletion procedures with verification
   - Data minimization practices
   - Access control for storage
   - Apply principle of least privilege for all operations

3. Privacy compliance (2025 requirements):
   - GDPR compliance, including automated DPIA/PIA documentation
   - Implement GDPR AI Act bias assessments for all AI-driven features
   - CCPA compliance with updated fine structure ($7,500 per violation)
   - Privacy-by-design architecture for all new and existing features
   - Local AI processing for user data where feasible; avoid unnecessary cloud processing
   - Real-time compliance monitoring for privacy and security events
   - Cross-jurisdictional compliance (GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulations)
   - User data access and export functionality
   - Implement "right to be forgotten" with complete data deletion
   - Transparent privacy notices and consent management mechanisms
   - Document all data processing activities and purposes

4. Security testing:
   - Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
   - Dependency security audits
   - Code security review
   - Browser security model compliance

5. Automated compliance documentation:
   - Automated generation and maintenance of DPIA/PIA records
   - Automated consent management and audit trails

6. Monitoring and reporting:
   - Real-time compliance and security monitoring dashboards
   - CSP violation reporting endpoints for continuous policy improvement
   - Regular review and update of compliance and security controls

# Test Strategy:
Test CSP implementation with security scanning tools and CSP violation reporting. Verify data encryption, secure deletion, and local AI processing. Test privacy compliance features (data access, deletion, consent management, DPIA/PIA automation). Conduct penetration testing on the extension. Validate security and privacy compliance with third-party security audit. Simulate cross-jurisdictional data requests and verify real-time compliance monitoring.
