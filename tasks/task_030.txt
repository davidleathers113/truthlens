# Task ID: 30
# Title: Implement Performance Benchmarking and Monitoring System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive performance benchmarking and monitoring system that ensures the extension meets PRD requirements: <1 second response time, <500ms page load impact, and <50MB memory overhead.
# Details:
Implement the performance monitoring system (src/shared/performance/) with the following components:

1. Core Performance Metrics Collection:
   - Create `PerformanceMonitor` class to track key metrics:
     - Response time for credibility analysis
     - Page load impact measurement
     - Memory usage tracking
     - CPU utilization monitoring
   - Implement sampling strategies to minimize monitoring overhead

2. Real-time Performance Dashboard:
   - Develop a performance visualization panel in the extension's developer mode
   - Create time-series graphs for all key metrics
   - Implement threshold indicators with color coding (green/yellow/red)
   - Add export functionality for performance reports

3. Automated Alert System:
   - Create configurable thresholds for all metrics
   - Implement notification system for threshold violations
   - Add logging infrastructure for performance anomalies
   - Create developer console warnings for critical performance issues

4. Performance Optimization Recommendations:
   - Analyze performance patterns to identify bottlenecks
   - Generate actionable recommendations based on detected issues
   - Provide code-level suggestions for optimization
   - Create a self-tuning system that adjusts parameters based on device capabilities

5. Integration Points:
   - Service Worker: Instrument AI processing and API calls
   - Content Script: Measure DOM manipulation and visual indicator impact
   - Add performance hooks to Chrome Built-in AI integration
   - Create performance interceptors for all critical paths

6. Implementation Details:
   ```typescript
   // src/shared/performance/monitor.ts
   export class PerformanceMonitor {
     private metrics: PerformanceMetrics = {
       responseTime: [],
       pageLoadImpact: [],
       memoryUsage: [],
       cpuUtilization: []
     };
     
     public startMeasurement(id: string): void {
       // Start performance measurement with unique ID
       performance.mark(`${id}-start`);
     }
     
     public endMeasurement(id: string, type: MetricType): number {
       // End measurement and record metric
       performance.mark(`${id}-end`);
       const measurement = performance.measure(
         id,
         `${id}-start`,
         `${id}-end`
       );
       
       this.metrics[type].push(measurement.duration);
       this.checkThresholds(type, measurement.duration);
       
       return measurement.duration;
     }
     
     private checkThresholds(type: MetricType, value: number): void {
       // Check if measurement exceeds thresholds
       if (value > THRESHOLDS[type].critical) {
         this.triggerAlert(type, 'critical', value);
       } else if (value > THRESHOLDS[type].warning) {
         this.triggerAlert(type, 'warning', value);
       }
     }
     
     // Additional methods for memory and CPU monitoring
   }
   ```

7. Memory Optimization:
   - Implement memory leak detection
   - Create garbage collection triggers for high-memory situations
   - Add resource cleanup for inactive tabs
   - Implement lazy loading for non-critical components

8. Storage Strategy:
   - Use IndexedDB for storing performance history
   - Implement data retention policies to prevent excessive storage
   - Create data aggregation for long-term trend analysis
   - Add export/import functionality for performance data

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for all performance monitoring components
   - Test threshold detection and alert triggering
   - Verify metric collection accuracy
   - Test data storage and retrieval functionality

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test integration with service worker and content scripts
   - Verify performance hooks don't introduce significant overhead
   - Test alert system end-to-end functionality
   - Validate optimization recommendation generation

3. Performance Benchmarking:
   - Create automated benchmark suite with the following test cases:
     - Response time: Measure time from content analysis request to score display
     - Page load impact: Compare page load times with and without extension
     - Memory usage: Monitor memory consumption during typical usage patterns
     - CPU utilization: Measure CPU usage during active analysis

4. Threshold Validation:
   - Test against PRD requirements:
     - <1 second response time with 95% accuracy
     - <500ms page load impact
     - <50MB memory overhead
   - Create test fixtures for various website complexities
   - Test on different device capabilities (high-end, mid-range, low-end)

5. Stress Testing:
   - Test with high volume of concurrent tabs (10+)
   - Measure performance degradation under sustained load
   - Test recovery after browser restarts
   - Verify graceful degradation when resources are constrained

6. User Experience Validation:
   - Conduct A/B testing with and without optimizations
   - Measure perceived performance with user testing
   - Validate that Gen Z users don't perceive performance impact
   - Test on popular websites frequented by target demographic

7. Continuous Monitoring:
   - Implement automated performance regression tests in CI/CD pipeline
   - Create performance dashboards for tracking metrics over time
   - Set up alerts for performance degradation between versions
   - Establish baseline performance metrics for comparison

8. Documentation:
   - Document all performance testing methodologies
   - Create performance troubleshooting guide
   - Document optimization recommendations for developers
   - Create user-facing performance settings documentation
