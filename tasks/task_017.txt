# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement External Fact-Checking API Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 12
# Priority: low
# Description: Integrate with external fact-checking APIs for enhanced credibility assessment.
# Details:
Develop integration with external fact-checking APIs (optional feature):

1. API client implementation:
   - Google Fact Check API integration
   - Media Bias/Fact Check API (if available)
   - Custom API abstraction layer

2. Privacy-preserving query design:
   - Minimal data transmission (domain names only)
   - User consent management
   - Local caching to reduce API calls

3. Result integration:
   - Incorporate API results into credibility score (20% weight)
   - Display fact-check sources and results
   - Handle API failures gracefully

Implement the API client with:
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Error handling and retry logic
- Response caching (24-hour default)
- Timeout handling (3-second maximum)

Create a privacy-first design that:
- Requires explicit user opt-in for API usage
- Transmits only essential data (domain, not full URL or content)
- Stores results locally to minimize API calls
- Provides clear disclosure about data usage

Develop a fallback mechanism that maintains basic functionality when:
- User has not opted into API usage
- APIs are unavailable or rate-limited
- Network connectivity is limited

# Test Strategy:
Test API integration with mock responses. Verify privacy controls and data transmission. Test caching and rate limiting. Validate error handling and fallback mechanisms. Measure impact on credibility scoring accuracy.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement API Client Abstraction Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a flexible abstraction layer for external fact-checking APIs with implementations for Google Fact Check API and other available services.
### Details:
Develop a base API client interface with common methods for querying fact-checking services. Implement concrete classes for Google Fact Check API and at least one other service (e.g., Media Bias/Fact Check if available, or PolitiFact). Include rate limiting, quota management, timeout handling (3-second maximum), and response caching (24-hour default). Use the adapter pattern to provide a consistent interface across different API providers.

## 2. Develop Privacy-Preserving Query System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system that minimizes data transmission to external APIs while maintaining effective fact-checking capabilities.
### Details:
Implement a query builder that extracts only essential information (domain names, not full URLs or content) for API requests. Create a user consent management system with explicit opt-in for API usage. Develop a local caching mechanism to store previous results and reduce redundant API calls. Include clear user-facing disclosures about what data is transmitted and how it's used.

## 3. Implement Result Processing and Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Process and integrate fact-checking API responses into the credibility assessment system.
### Details:
Create parsers for each supported API response format. Develop a normalization system to convert varied API responses into a standardized internal format. Implement logic to incorporate API results into the credibility score (weighted at 20%). Design a component to display fact-check sources and results in the UI. Include metadata such as check dates, sources, and confidence levels.

## 4. Build Fallback and Error Handling System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop robust error handling and fallback mechanisms to maintain functionality when APIs are unavailable.
### Details:
Implement comprehensive error handling for API failures, timeouts, and rate limiting. Create a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient errors. Develop a fallback system that maintains basic functionality when APIs are unavailable or when users haven't opted in. Design the system to gracefully degrade by using cached results or alternative assessment methods when external APIs cannot be reached.

## 5. Optimize API Usage and Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement strategies to optimize API usage, reduce costs, and improve performance.
### Details:
Develop a batching system to combine multiple queries where APIs support it. Implement intelligent caching strategies with variable TTLs based on content type and volatility. Create a monitoring system to track API usage, costs, and performance metrics. Implement adaptive rate limiting that adjusts based on remaining quota. Optimize the timing of API calls to balance immediacy with user experience (e.g., prefetch for frequently visited domains).
