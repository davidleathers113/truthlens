# Task ID: 10
# Title: Create Popup Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the extension popup UI for user interaction and settings.
# Details:
Implement the extension popup interface (src/popup/) using React:

1. Main popup component with status display and controls
2. Settings management interface
3. Quick actions and toggles
4. Status information and statistics

The popup interface should include:
- Current status indicator (enabled/disabled)
- Quick toggle for enabling/disabling the extension
- Settings access for detailed configuration
- Statistics display (checks performed, sites analyzed)
- Premium feature promotion for free tier users
- Account management for premium subscribers

Implement responsive design for various popup sizes:
- Default size: 320x480px
- Compact mode: 280x400px
- Expanded mode: 360x600px

Use React 18 with functional components and hooks:
- useState and useEffect for state management
- useContext for settings and theme
- useReducer for complex state logic
- Custom hooks for storage and background communication

# Test Strategy:
Unit test React components with React Testing Library. Test responsive layouts with different dimensions. Verify state management with various user interactions. Test communication with background service worker using mocks. Validate accessibility with automated tools.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Popup Component Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic React component structure for the popup interface with routing and layout containers.
### Details:
Create the main App component in src/popup/App.jsx that will serve as the entry point. Implement a responsive container that adapts to the three required sizes (320x480px, 280x400px, 360x600px). Set up React Router for navigation between main views. Create placeholder components for each major section (StatusDisplay, QuickActions, Settings, Statistics). Implement theme context provider for consistent styling.

## 2. Implement Status Indicator and Toggle [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create the status indicator component showing enabled/disabled state with a toggle switch for quick activation.
### Details:
Develop StatusIndicator component with visual cues for active/inactive states. Implement toggle switch component that updates extension state. Create custom hook (useExtensionStatus) to communicate with background script for status changes. Add animations for state transitions. Ensure the toggle is accessible with keyboard navigation and proper ARIA attributes.

## 3. Build Settings Management Interface [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create the settings panel allowing users to configure extension preferences and options.
### Details:
Implement SettingsPanel component with form controls for all configurable options. Create sections for general settings, notification preferences, and analysis sensitivity. Use useReducer for complex settings state management. Implement form validation for settings inputs. Create persistence layer using Chrome Storage API through a custom useStorage hook. Add reset to defaults functionality.

## 4. Develop Statistics Display Component [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create the statistics panel showing usage metrics like checks performed and sites analyzed.
### Details:
Build StatsDisplay component with counters for key metrics. Implement data visualization using lightweight charts (consider recharts or visx). Create custom hook (useStats) to fetch statistics from background storage. Add time-based filtering (daily/weekly/monthly views). Implement auto-refresh mechanism to keep stats current. Include export functionality for statistics data.

## 5. Implement Quick Actions Panel [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Create a panel with shortcut buttons for common actions and features.
### Details:
Develop QuickActions component with icon buttons for frequent tasks. Implement actions like 'Scan Current Page', 'View History', 'Clear Data', etc. Create tooltips for each action button. Implement action handlers that communicate with background script. Add keyboard shortcuts for power users. Include visual feedback for action completion.
