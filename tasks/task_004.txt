# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Shared Type Definitions and Utilities
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Define TypeScript interfaces, types, and utility functions shared across the extension.
# Details:
Create a shared types and utilities module (src/shared/) with the following components:

1. TypeScript interfaces for all data structures:
   - `CredibilityScore` interface with score, confidence, and factors
   - `ContentAnalysis` interface with extracted content and metadata
   - `UserSettings` interface for configuration options
   - `PlatformInfo` interface for website-specific data

2. Utility functions:
   - URL parsing and normalization
   - Domain extraction and validation
   - Date/time formatting and calculations
   - Error handling and logging

3. Constants and enumerations:
   - Supported platforms list
   - Credibility score thresholds (green/yellow/red)
   - Default settings values
   - Error message templates

Ensure all types use strict TypeScript configurations with proper nullability handling and readonly properties where appropriate.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test all utility functions with various inputs including edge cases. Verify type definitions with sample data. Test constants for correctness and completeness.
